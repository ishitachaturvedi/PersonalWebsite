I am a fifth year PhD student in the [Liberty Research Group](https://liberty.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. David August](http://august.princeton.edu/). My research focus lies in the domain of High Performance Computing. More specifially I am intersted in efficient utilisation of compuation hardware resources and performance extraction using GPUs and unification of the GPU-CPU architectures. Before joining Princeton University I completed my Bachelors' in Physics at Delhi University, India. 


I work extensively on exploring and understanding the parallelism offered by the CPU and the GPU and its limitations. The aim of my research is to bridge the gap between CPUs and GPUs and to bring them closer. Before jumping head on into computer science with a focus on computer architecture I completed my undergraduate education in Physics. As an undergraduate I worked on developing a Radio Transient detection pipeline at the [National Center for Radio Astrophysics](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/). The pipeline was developed in CUDA and was looking for pulsars in real time. While working on this project I realised how hard it is to write efficient GPU code! While a GPU can theoretically give unprecedented speedup it is very difficult to realise in practical implementation. With my experience working with GPUs I decided to pursure computer architecture to make GPUs more efficient and easy to program on.
