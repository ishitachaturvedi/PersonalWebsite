I will be interning at AMD Research this summer working on offloading tasks from CPUs to connected accelerators!

***


As we have an more accelerators on a chip, offloading tasks between devices is becoming a bottleneck. To break this bottleneck we need efficient task offloading, especially when tasks are independent and don's need to stall. I will be working on solving this problem this summer :smile:
